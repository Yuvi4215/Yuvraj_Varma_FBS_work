## Write a program to calculate area of rectangle based on length and breadth.

# Take Length and Breadth values from user as input
length=int(input('Enter the Length :: '))
breadth=int(input('Enter the Breadth :: '))


# Calculate the area 
area = length*breadth

# Display the results
print(f'The total Area calculated is :: {area} units')
